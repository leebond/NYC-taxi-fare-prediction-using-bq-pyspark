# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction using Simple Linear Regression with BigQuery and PySpark

### Description
Running a Simple Linear Regression on a regression problem might not be the state-of-the-art way to learn parameters. However, when the volumn of data increases drastically, state-of-the-art algorithms will not be able to learn parameters quick enough even with the best computing resources.

As such, in this repo, I attempt the use of a simple linear regression to predict NYC taxi fares which has over 100 million records per year in a single SQL table.

The data is stored in BigQuery and PySpark would be the tool to go for such big data tasks.
